## Another one?!

Tic Tac Toe apps have apparently replaced TODO lists in recent years. My implementation predates [the official "Intro to React" Tic Tac Toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by [~5 months](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/aa9544bfac6603aa7e7ab978be97011ad4d64012#diff-3ccbede9e75746bc98284acd56d132a9) and takes a different approach. Over time, this project has become my "keep up with React best practices" test bed: its state management and user interactivity is just complex enough to kick the tires on new React releases and adjust as necessary.
