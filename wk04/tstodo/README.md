# To-Do application with Create React App

This project is to create a to-do list management app which is syilish and easy to maintain. The repository has been evolved from whimsical tinkering to refactored neat code structure following the online class of MIT xPRO Front-End Development with React.

In the "public" folder, you need to put index.html and styles.css. In the "src" folder, put index.js, form.js, and todo.js.
